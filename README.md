# PainterDecorator

TO RUN THIS PROJECT YOU CAN COPY THE LATEST COPY OF THE CODE AND RUN IN VISUAL STUDIO DOWNLOADABLE FORM [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/Downloads/?q=Visual%20Studio]

IT IS A SIMPLE CONSOLE APPLICATION SO DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY EXTRA ADDONS OR TOOLS.

Scenario
Write a program that takes as input the dimensions of a room and outputs the following:

1). Area of the floor

2). Amount of paint required to paint the walls (not the ceiling)

3). Volume of the room


The only assumption that is made is that as it is a mathematical problem then only numerical values will be accepted.


An additional feature could include adding a wallpaper calculator for the ceiling.

N.B metric units of measurement only.
